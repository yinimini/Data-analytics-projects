# Data-analytics-projects
Just a girl who tries to find answers in data, I use Python to collect, process, and visualize the data. Here is a repository and visualizations of all my data analysis projects.

# Menstrual cycle analysis
Tool: Python

This project involves collecting and modifying data, as well as visualizing it. The analysis focuses on the duration of cycles and periods, as well as the recurrence of symptoms. Probabilities of symptom occurrence are also calculated:

# Sales report analysis
Tool: Power BI

This project shows core visualizations including a table to track product sales and delivery status, a column chart highlighting revenue-generating product categories, and a line chart providing insight into sales trends. Additionally, KPIs are developed to gauge sales performance and customer reach.

# Frequency Delta Sigma Modulator (FDSM) performance analysis
Tool: Python 

This project involves collecting and cleansing data, as well as visualizing it. This analysis focuses on FDSM's performace parameters in both frequency and time domains, here are some of the visualization:
